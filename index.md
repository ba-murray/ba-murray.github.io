## Data Science Projects

### Supervised Learning
A type of machine learning that uses labeled datasets to train algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes.
**Predicting Reservation Cancellations**

[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](Predicting_Cancelations.html)
<div style="text-align: justify">Free cancellation policies have resulted in an increase in cancellation and rebooking activity as rates are slashed to secure occupancy. Hotels with low occupancy rates are particularly vulnerable to the change in the consumer. Data shows that higher guest engagement and personalization may result in lower cancellation and rebooking rates. In this project I will perform a comprehensive EDA and will build machine learning models to predict the probability that a guest will cancel their reservation. </div>

### Unsupervised Learning
A type of machine learning that uses algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets.
**Principal Components Analysis on Nutritional Information**

<div style="text-align: justify">PCA is fundamentally a dimensionality reduction algorithm, but it can also be useful as a tool for visualization, noise filtering and feature extraction.The data used for the project contains food items and a break down of their nutrients across 23 variables. After cleaning and performing a simple EDA, I will try to reduce the variables of the data set while retaining as much variance as possible. </div>

### Deep Learning
A type of machine learning based on artificial neural networks. A neural network is a method in artificial intelligence that teaches computers to process data in a way that is inspired by the human brain.
**Predicting Stroke Risk with Basic Neural Networks**

[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](Pred_stroke.html)
I have built a neural network from scratch and applied it to a data set with 11 predictor variables to predict stroke risk.

### Python EDA
**Vehicle Collision Fatalities EDA**

[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](Car_Fatality_Analysis.html)
<div style="text-align: justify">In this project I am going to perform a simple EDA with python on the Vehicle Collision Fatalities dataset. I have also outlined the next steps for a stronger analysis. </div>

### Excel
**Weather Station Dashboard**

<div style="text-align: justify">A dashboard built from historical data to help predict precipitation and temperature during the the growing season. I collected data from various weather stations from the NOAA API. The data was in JSON and was uploaded, cleaned and manipulated with Excel. The dashboard was created in Excel.</div>
