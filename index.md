**Predicting Reservation Cancellations**

<div style="text-align: justify">Free cancellation policies have resulted in an increase in cancellation and rebooking activity as rates are slashed to secure occupancy. Hotels with low occupancy rates are particularly vulnerable to the change in the consumer. Data shows that higher guest engagement and personalization may result in lower cancellation and rebooking rates. In this project I will perform a comprehensive EDA and will build models to predict the probability that a guest will cancel their reservation. </div>

<div style="text-align: justify">I built a weather dashboard from historical data to help predict precipitation and temperature in the summer months. I collected data from various weather stations from the NOAA API. The data was in JSON and was uploaded, cleaned and manipulated with Excel. The dashboard was created in Excel.</div>
